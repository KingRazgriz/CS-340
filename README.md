1.	How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
	
I aim to build modular, well-documented systems like the CRUD module to solve real problems efficiently. My work on Grazioso Salvare's dashboard project taught me to separate database logic from application design, creating adaptable tools that save time. This required practical choices about scalability and usability that would directly impact users. Moving forward, I should focus on agile development and user feedback to build solutions that truly meet organizational needs while maintaining clean, reusable code.

2.	How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

When working on Grazioso Salvare's project, I started by analyzing their needs and designing a flexible database system through iterative development. This real-world challenge required me to make independent technical decisions and validate solutions through rigorous testing—a more practical approach than academic projects. The experience reinforced my problem-solving method of understanding requirements deeply, evaluating options critically, and refining solutions continuously.

3.	What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

As a computer scientist, I see every project as an opportunity to solve real challenges through technology. When I built Grazioso Salvare's dashboard, the goal wasn’t just to write code. I created a system that automated their animal matching process, saving them valuable time and resources. By developing modular components, I ensured they could easily adapt or reuse parts of the system later. This experience reinforced my belief that our work matters most when it helps organizations focus on their core mission while we handle the technical solutions.
